KNN is a model that classifies data points based on the points that are most similar to it. It uses test data to make an “educated guess” on what an unclassified point should be classified as.


Pros:
Easy to use.
Quick calculation time.
Does not make assumptions about the data.


Cons:
Accuracy depends on the quality of the data.
Must find an optimal k value (number of nearest neighbors).
